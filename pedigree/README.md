This folder contains code for crawling the Potato Pedigree Database, which is hosted by the Laboratory of Plant Breeding at
Wageningen University & Research.

The database is described by this paper:

> R van Berloo, RCB Hutten, HJ van Eck and RGF Visser
> (2007). [An online potato pedigree database resource](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11540-007-9028-3). Potato research 50
> 45-57

It appears clear that the data can be reused, despite there not being a specific licence attached, since the paper says that:

* "The online potato pedigree database is a free Web resource".
* The authors have "provided the potato community with a valuable and useful resource".
* The web interface was created "to allow others to use this data set for their own purposes".

The database can be found at https://www.plantbreeding.wur.nl/PotatoPedigree/.
